For my final project at Entity, I’ve chosen to look at sea ice data. I chose sea ice because I’ve always been fascinated by animals that live in the arctic, mainly penguins who are my favorite animal. Over the next 6 weeks I hope I will be able to show others that we can accurately predict the sea ice thickness using data we have available now.


The data I am using is from https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/cryo/data/antarctic-sea-ice-thickness. The data runs from October- November ’03 to February- March ’08. I will not be using all the data available during those months but instead breaking it up into 2 groups, Group and GroupA. Group will be October- November ’03 to May- June ’04 and GroupA will be March- April ’07 to February- March ’08. Group includes 1,728,977 rows of 6 variables and GroupA includes 997,691 rows of 6 variables. The variables include Time (in UTC from 1-1-2000 format), Latitude, Longitude, Sea Ice Freeboard, Sea Ice Thickness and Month/Day (in the Year/Month/Day HH:MM:SS format). Latitude and Longitude are both in the Polar Stereographic form and I am hoping to add another column that will list Lat/Lon in the Geodetic form.
