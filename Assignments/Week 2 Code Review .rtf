\f0\fs24 \cf0 This week I worked on finding my data, grouping it into 2 groups (Group & GroupA) for machine learning, adding a column and then changing the styling of the date from UTC to YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS and adding it into the new column. The code runs smoothly and has explanations built in so that others know what I\'92m doing. I feel like I\'92m further along in this project than I planned to be at this point and I am excited to learn more from the data this next week. }
